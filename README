This is a fork of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-facebook turned into a maven repo specifically for the purpose of keeping at least the login functionality working with the Facebook Graph API 2.10

=========================== Spring Social Facebook ===========================
To check out the project and build from source, do the following:

 git clone git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-facebook.git
 cd spring-social-facebook
 ./gradlew build

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate Eclipse metadata (.classpath and .project files), do the following:

 ./gradlew eclipse

Once complete, you may then import the projects into Eclipse as usual:

 File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate IDEA metadata (.iml and .ipr files), do the following:

 ./gradlew idea

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the JavaDoc, do the following from within the root directory:

 ./gradlew :docs:api

The result will be available in 'docs/build/api'.
